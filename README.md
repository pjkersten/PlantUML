Hi, welcome to the [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) plugin for ![Mediawiki Icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/MediaWiki_logo_reworked_2.svg/154px-MediaWiki_logo_reworked_2.svg.png "MediaWiki Icon")[MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki).
The full project page for this plugin can be found on 

   http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PlantUML
   

# Prerequisites
1. A ![Java Icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/thumb/e/e1/Java-Logo.svg/75px-Java-Logo.svg.png "Java") [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) installation. Can also be [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/)

2. [GraphViz extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GraphViz)

3. Prerequistes of GraphViz. Basically if you get the GraphViz extension running you should also be able to get PlantUML to run.

# Installation

## With Composer
[Composer support is in preparation] (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User_talk:Legoktm#Adding_Extension_PlantUML_to_packagist)


## Without Composer

1. Go to the extensions folder of your MediaWiki installation. On RedHat and
   derivates this will be /usr/share/mediawiki/extensions.
   `cd /usr/share/mediawiki/extensions`

2. Create a new subdirectory PlantUML in this folder and move to this
   directory.
   `mkdir PlantUML && cd PlantUML`
   
3. Move the all downloaded file (PlantUML.php, PlantUML.body.php, extension.json, i18n, ...) into the PlantUML directory.
   `mv <downloaddir>/{PlantUML.php,PlantUML.body.php,extension.json,i18n}`.

4. Choose your usage style. You can either process images locally (on the
   server where MediaWiki was installed) or in the cloud. The local version
   supports SVG-images and embedded urls, at the cost of local processing.
   The cloud version is lightweight for your server.
   Default local processing is expected. If you want to use the cloud,
   please set to LocalSettings.php $wgPlantUmlUseCloude to true.

5. When using local processing: get the plantuml.jar from SourceForge

   `wget https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/plantuml/plantuml.jar`
   
6. (Optional) Set to LocalSettings.php the variable $wgPlantUmlFormat
   to your preference. Mind that SVG produces the superior graphics, but that
   only PNG-images and image maps are "rock solid". (defaults: svg)

7. (Optional) Adapt the getUploadPath and getUploadDirectory to your
   preference if you want these different from MediaWiki's standard settings.
   Mind that these directories must be writeable by the system user who runs
   MediaWiki.

8. Put the following line to your LocalSettings.php in
   MediaWiki's root folder to include the extension:
   
   `wfLoadExtension( 'PlantUML' );`

9. When using the cloud, make sure that httpd can submit HTTP-requests.
   (Optional) Adapt $wgPlantUmlCloudURI to use your private PlantUml server

10. Reload http
   `service httpd graceful

11. Enjoy!
